# Frontend

This directory is reserved for the user-facing application. The pilot will eventually use a React/Next.js interface. For now, this folder contains documentation and starter files.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Create a new Next.js project when ready:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest
   ```

Additional instructions will be added as the project evolves.
